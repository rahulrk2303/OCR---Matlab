Start with a weighted graph Choose a starting vertex and assign
* innity path values to all other vertites

 

3 4

an to each vertex adjacent to this If the path length of adjacent vertex is

vertex and update its path length lesser than new path length, don‘!
update it.

 

5 6
Avoid updating path lengths ol Afte_r_eath itevatiofl. we Pitk the
ahvgady visited veniees unvisited vertex with least

path length. So we chose 5 belore 7

 

7 8

Notice how the rightmost vertex Repeal until all the vertires have
has its path length updated twice been visited
